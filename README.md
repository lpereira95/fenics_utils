# `fenics_utils`

Collection of utils to accelerate numerical code development with [`fenics`](https://fenicsproject.org/).


It can be installed via `pip`:


```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/lpereira95/fenics_utils.git@master
```


For now, the code is very unstable, as we are at an initial development stage. If you consider to use part of the code, please make sure you know the commit from which you installed the library (to ensure your code doesn't get broken).
